Repeat parts b and c for the case of :math:`H=1.5W` (except for validation). How does the flow change in this rectangular cavity as compared to the flow in a sqaure cavity?

 Re = 100

In this section, two choices of grid spacing conditions were made to see the effect of grid size on the qualitative pattern of flow field. Only the streamline is considered for discussions.

- NxN = 20x30

<Streamlines for 20x30 case>


- NxN = 40x60

.. image:: ./images/Re100/strm_40x60.png
   :width: 50%

<Streamlines for 40x60 case>


- Observation

  - Very distinctive flow feature is observed from two different grid spacing choice.
  - Higher number of grid points resolves more distinctive vortext at two bottom corners.
  - The center of main vortex close to lid is identically positioned with different grid sets.

 Re = 500

The current test is conducted with higher Reynolds number condition. 

- NxN = 20x30

<Streamlines for 20x30 case>

- NxN = 40x60

.. image:: ./images/Re500/strm_40x60.png
   :width: 50%

<Streamlines for 40x60 case>


- Observations

  - The higher Reynolds number condition makes two distinctive and opposite direction of vortex vector.
